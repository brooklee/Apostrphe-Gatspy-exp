# Apostrophe 3 demo and test project

## Get started

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. At the moment, you must have a local copy of `apostrophe` using the `3.0` branch and link that to this project. In whatever local directory you keep your dev work in, run:
   1. `git clone git@github.com:apostrophecms/apostrophe.git && cd apostrophe`
   2. `git fetch && git checkout 3.0` to get on the correct branch.
   3. `npm link` to set Apostrophe up for linking in the project.
3. Back in the `a3-demo` project, link up Apostrophe: `npm link apostrophe`.

## Running the project

Run `npm run dev` to build the Apostrophe UI and start the site up. Remember, this is during alpha development, so we're all in "dev mode."

## Analyzing bundle size

It is possible to analyze the size of the admin UI webpack bundle:

```
APOS_BUNDLE_ANALYZER=1 node app @apostrophecms/asset:build
```

This will display a visualization in your browser.

As of this writing, we are not optimizing the webpack build for production, so expect to see big numbers.

## Apostrophe Storybook Component Library

### Run the UI Library

To spin up the UI component library (including to work on Apostrophe UI components) run `npm run storybook`. By default, the storybook library will run at http://localhost:9001.

### Deploying to the Static Site

```
$ npm run deploy-storybook
```

This script will run the build to the `.out` directory and trigger a deploy to the `gh-pages` branch.

### Using Vue Dev Tools with Storybook
Storybook operates in a number of layered iframes, obscuring Vue Dev Tools from reading your Vue states. You can use the standalone Electron Vue Dev Tool application to drill into your stories, just

```
$ npm install -g @vue/devtools
======================[100%]==
$ vue-devtools
```

And make sure the port your `vue-devtools` is looking for matches the one specified in Apostrophe core's `modules/@apostrophecms/storybook/template/.storybook/preview-head.html` (currently `http://localhost:8098`).
